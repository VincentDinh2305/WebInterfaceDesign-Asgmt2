<h3><i>What is a protected area?</i></h3>
<p>
Protected areas are important tools for the conservation of biological
diversity and are cornerstones of sustainable development strategies.
Aside from their environmental benefits, they can also generate significant economic resources. As such protected areas are crucial for
attaining the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity
and meeting the 2010 biodiversity target and the Millennium
Development Goals.
</p><p>
Currently numbering in excess of 100,000 and covering about 11.6%
of the Earth’s terrestrial surface, protected areas harbor great biological richness and are a major source of material and non-material
wealth. They represent important stocks of natural, cultural and social capital, supporting the livelihood
and wellbeing of many. For example a study conducted in 2003 found that 33 of the world’s 105 largest cities
obtain a significant proportion of their drinking water from protected areas. Providing this water through
other means would likely be a costly endeavor and beyond the means of some cities.

Throughout the history of protected areas the common thread is the focus on providing for life now and into
the future. Indeed, the Convention on Biological Diversity recognizes protected areas as a fundamental tool
for safeguarding biodiversity, life itself. The intrinsic values of biodiversity are arguably reason enough for
safeguarding life through protected areas.
</p><p>
Yet, an equally valuable argument can be made that human well-being is dependent directly and indirectly on
biodiversity. Nature’s genetic, species and ecosystem diversity is a source of fibre, food and ecosystem services,
such as fresh water and clean air, assures the well being of humans around the world. A sound environment
with a full complement of species underpins economic stability and human livelihoods over time.

The Campaign for Nature’s goal to protect 30 percent of Earth’s land and ocean is rooted in the benefits that protected areas provide for biodiversity and the associated ecosystem services.
</p><p>
Effectively managed protected areas are a critical tool for safeguarding biodiversity,
maintaining ecosystem balance, preserving important habitats,
building resilience to climate change, providing global food security,
maintaining water quality, conserving natural resources, driving economic success,
curbing the spread of diseases and pests, and providing many other benefits to wildlife and human health.

</p><p>
<h4>Significance</h4>
</p><p>
Protected areas (PAs) are a key strategy for conserving nature and halting the loss of biodiversity. Our results show that while many PAs are effective, the large focus on increasing terrestrial coverage toward 17% of the earth surface has led to many PAs failing to stem human pressure. This is particularly the case for nonforested areas, which have not been assessed in previous analysis. Thus, we show that relying only on studies of remote-sensed forest cover can produce a biased picture of the effectiveness of PAs. Moving forward beyond the current biodiversity targets, there is a need to ensure that quality rather than quantity is better integrated and measured.
</p><p>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
</p><p>
One-sixth of the global terrestrial surface now falls within protected areas (PAs), making it essential to understand how far they mitigate the increasing pressures on nature which characterize the Anthropocene. In by far the largest analysis of this question to date and not restricted to forested PAs, we compiled data from 12,315 PAs across 152 countries to investigate their ability to reduce human pressure and how this varies with socioeconomic and management circumstances. While many PAs show positive outcomes, strikingly we find that compared with matched unprotected areas, PAs have on average not reduced a compound index of pressure change over the past 15 y. Moreover, in tropical regions average pressure change from cropland conversion has increased inside PAs even more than in matched unprotected areas. However, our results also confirm previous studies restricted to forest PAs, where pressures are increasing, but less than in counterfactual areas. Our results also show that countries with high national-level development scores have experienced lower rates of pressure increase over the past 15 y within their PAs compared with a matched outside area. Our results caution against the rapid establishment of new PAs without simultaneously addressing the conditions needed to enable their success.

<h4>By Joel Heinen</h4>
</p><p>
Traditional human societies have protected natural areas for various cultural purposes for millennia. Examples include the sacred forests of South Asia and parts of Africa, sacred burial grounds of some native American groups and traditional royal hunting reserves in many parts of Europe, Asia and Africa, which were generally only seasonally opened for hunting by royalty (Borgerhoff Mulder & Coppolillo, 2006). The modern concept of the national ownership and protection of natural areas for the benefit of society at large is a much more recent phenomenon; the United States became the first country to conserve nationally protected areas with the creation of Yellowstone National Park in 1872. This Category II (below) protected area is now close to 9,000 square kilometers in size and was inscribed as a World Heritage Natural Site in 1978.

</p><p>
<h4>Background</h4>
</p><p>
Establishing Protected Areas (PAs) is among the most common conservation interventions. Protecting areas from the threats posed by human activity will by definition inhibit some human actions. However, adverse impacts could be balanced by maintaining ecosystem services or introducing new livelihood options. Consequently there is an ongoing debate on whether the net impact of PAs on human well-being at local or regional scales is positive or negative. We report here on a systematic review of evidence for impacts on human well-being arising from the establishment and maintenance of terrestrial PAs.
</p><p>
<h4>Methods</h4>
</p><p>
Following an a priori protocol, systematic searches were conducted for evidence of impacts of PAs post 1992. After article title screening, the review was divided into two separate processes; a qualitative synthesis of explanations and meaning of impact and a review of quantitative evidence of impact. Abstracts and full texts were assessed using inclusion criteria and conceptual models of potential impacts. Relevant studies were critically appraised and data extracted and sorted according to type of impact reported. No quantitative synthesis was possible with the evidence available. Two narrative syntheses were produced and their outputs compared in a metasynthesis.
